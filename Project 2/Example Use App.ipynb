It is still not completely clear whether higher population results in lower crimes committed. Other factors such as population density, differing state laws, methods of recording crime count, time, and possible more could be confounding the relationship. We know that population has a gradual increase over the years, so law enforcement may have improved over time to prevent crimes."
